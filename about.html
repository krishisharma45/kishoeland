				<br>
				<br>
				<p>I started kishoeland.com in January 2019. It was only a domain name then.</p>
				<br>
				<p>In February, I made a new friend at work. We both hated work and felt like we could be doing more important things (this is, apparently, a common feeling). This website is dedicated to that friendship.</p>
				<br>
				<p>This story is meant to educate, entertain, and inspire us to grow young, like Luv and Kishoe. More than ever, we need to be <b>brave</b>, not afraid; <b>encouraged</b>, not shamed.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Follow Luv + Kishoe as they explore Kishoeland. If you have any thoughts or comments, message me on Instagram, @kishoeland</p>
				<br>
				<p>Thanks for visiting!</p>
